Algorithms:
    Advanced Encryption Standard
        AES is based on a design principle known as a substitutionâ€“permutation network, and is efficient in both software and hardware.

    Blowfish
        Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in many cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date.

    Data Encrytion Standard
        The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.
